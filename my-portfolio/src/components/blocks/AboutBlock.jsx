      <p className="mt-4 text-white">
        My journey into web development began when I realized the power of
        coding to bring ideas to life. Whether it's building interactive
        websites, optimizing user experiences, or diving into backend systems, I
        enjoy every step of the process. When I'm not coding, you can find me
        exploring new tech trends, learning new skills, or contributing to
        open-source projects.
